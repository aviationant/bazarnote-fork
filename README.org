*warning*: Basic functionalities haven't been implemented yet. So cloning is discouraged right now.

** what it is

Bazarnote is actually a simple note taking app. It only keeps very minimal information of items being bought in offline marketing. When going to a shop or a bazaar, we need to buy many items. Sometimes it is difficult to track all the items. There Bazarnote may come in handy.

It is a simple application. You don't need to be online for the app being functional. Just open the app, give your necessary information, keep track of your products and that's all.
