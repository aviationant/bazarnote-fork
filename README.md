## what it is

Bazarnote is actually a simple note taking app. It only keeps very minimal information of items being bought in offline marketing. When going to a shop or a bazaar, we need to buy many items. Sometimes it is difficult to track all the items. There Bazarnote may come in handy.

It is a simple application. You don\'t need to be online for the app being functional. Just open the app, give your necessary information, keep track of your products and that\'s all.

## build the app

See [BUILD_INFO.org](BUILD_INFO.org) file for details.
